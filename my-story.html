        <h2>My Roots</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a little village called Oxie. Outside of Oxie, you find the major city, Malmö. I was born and raised there.
            During my time as a child, I was the odd one out. I had a neighbor as a friend, and 2 little ones that I was mostly babysitting.
        My family consists of my Mother, my Father and two brothers. I am the youngest. I had a supportive family. They stood by me when things were though
    in school, and they still do. After I got my first xbox, I kind of locked myself in as much as possible. When I got my first pc, which was an old and used one, my interest start flowing..
    The computer itself was old, worn out and incredbly slow. I wanted to fix that without chaning the hardware, since the budget was tight. </p>

        <h2>Growing up</h2>
        <p>During my time growing up, It slowly became time to apply for schools, choosing what I was going to do the rest of my life. 
            That is a decision that always will be tough. I was not in the top of the class sort of speak, so my options were quite limited. In school,
            I was always a misfit, a stranger, a outcast. So going to school was nothing I wanted to do. But since I needed my grades, I packed it all up to a giant
            kind of test. I started long before anyone else on a monday morning, and I sat there all day long, test after test. The next day, the same thing.
            But the question still remained. What school? What job and what future? 
            In a desperat attempt, I choose to look around my surroundnings. My father was a glazier. My mother took care of elders. My oldest brother worked with my dad, and my second brother barely worked during the time.
            That was the moment a mutal friend came to recommend a school. It was a school for Truck education, and it would secure drivers license and a job.
            So thats were I ended up. During my education, I acctually got some interest in the heavy machines. I started to feel like I belong.

        <h2>From school to The Reality</h2>
        <p>By the end of my education, I got a job offer. Happy as I was, I accepted it, barely paying attention to the details. The pay per hour sounded good.
            And on top of that, my oldest brother had just promised me that if I get a signed contract, he would loan me money for my first car.
        </p>

            <p>After returning to school for the last days, I wanted to brag about my accomplishment. That is when I got a slap in the face from my class-mates.
                The pay per hour, was way below what is legally right. If I had pay attention to class, I would know that. Therefore, that was my first taste of the reality.
            I wish I could blame it on the person convincing me to sign the contract, but I know I can't. Simply, just because I was a adult at the time, and it was my responsibility to double Check
        what I actually signed. </p>

        <h2>Like a rocket into adulthood</h2>
        <p>As I turned 19, I met the love of my life. Things were perfect and I couldn't be happier. For the first time, I felt I belonged.
            Before I turned 20, we got our first child. In sweden, you have to be 20 to buy alcohol, so I didn't get to celebrate with champagne..
            I started to adpat to the adulthood being a father, but the more time I spent home, the more insecure I got about my job as a
            truckdriver. Not even 2 years later (2019) we got our second child. As the life of being a father grew on me, I searched for a different challenge.
            I took a job as a truck-mounted crane driver. My working days became unbelivebly long, and the time spent home reduced a lot.
            After a year, I sat my foot down, and by the time, corona was just around the corner. I was asked to search for a new job.
            I ended up on rooftops, mounting safety railings and nets for construction workers on high heights. From there, I missed the communication
            with customers, therefore I applied for a school to educate myself to be a Busnines Salesman. But after a year, it still didn't feel right.
            While watching a youtube video, an ad came up. It was for Code Institute. I tried the 5 day code challenge and I fell in love with coding.
            There is still a lot to learn though, but the funny thing about it all, is that you will never learn it all.
