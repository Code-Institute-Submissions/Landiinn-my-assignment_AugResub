My project has been created in the purpose of learning HTML/CSS

This is a website designed to get to know me better. 
It was great fun building it and testing it. 

The codes I have used is a mix of my thoughts and Ideas, tips from my mentor, youtube videos and website. 
I have used these codes and adapted them, some more, some less to fit my needs and wishes to this website.

My thoughts about this is that I wanted to test what you can do, and I want to share a short story about me at the same time.

websites that I used was: w3schools.com, codeinstitute.net
The youtube video I used to design my nav buttons is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex7jGbyFgpA
Although I changed much with the codes, deleting some I didnt want, the Idea and the codes came from this tutorial.
My mentor also helped me with the first hero Image.

I am proud of this project, considering I have never done anything like this before. And never thought I could do it.

My code, html and css had been validated though https://validator.w3.org/.
