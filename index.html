                flipping
                every rock just to find somewhere to belong.
                I am a father of two, married to a wonderful wife, and I, finally found where I want to be, and what I
                want to
                do.
                I started my career as a truckdriver, working 7 to 16 everyday. Day after day, the same grind.
                Today, I am doing whatever I can to get an edge in the world of coding.
                Looking at every blog, every Youtube video and every provided lesson to be able to learn as much as
                possible.

                you are
                having the same struggle as I did.
                Getting stuck in the part of life where everyting is just running on Auto, but it doesn't fit you.
                Check out my <a id="storyswipe" href="my-story.html">story page</a> if you want to find out who I am,
                where I
                come from, and how I could go from driving a 32 ton truck to sitting by a desk.
