            <p id="para-2">I am the person, who always have been searching for more. Who always has been searching and
                flipping
                every rock just to find somewhere to belong.
                I am a father of two, married to a wonderful wife, and I, finally found where I want to be, and what I
                want to
                do.
                I started my career as a truckdriver, working 7 to 16 everyday. Day after day, the same grind.
                Today, I am doing whatever I can to get an edge in the world of coding.
                Looking at every blog, every Youtube video and every provided lesson to be able to learn as much as
                possible.

            <h2>Why am I reading this?</h2>
            <p id="para-1">Well, maybe you are curios. Maybe you're just here to put a grade to my project. Or perhaps,
                you are
                having the same struggle as I did.
                Getting stuck in the part of life where everyting is just running on Auto, but it doesn't fit you.
                Check out my <a id="storyswipe" href="my-story.html">story page</a> if you want to find out who I am,
                where I
                come from, and how I could go from driving a 32 ton truck to sitting by a desk.
